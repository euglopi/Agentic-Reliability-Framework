# **Agentic Reliability Framework**

**Agentic Reliability Framework** is a production-grade, multi-layer AI reliability system designed for modern cloud and enterprise environments. 

It continuously monitors critical business services, detects anomalies in real time, explains impact in business terms, and triggers policy-based self-healing actions.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

At its core, the system uses **3 specialized AI agents** working together:

- **🕵️ Detective Agent** — anomaly detection and pattern recognition across latency, error rate, and throughput  
- **🔍 Diagnostic Agent** — root-cause analysis and incident investigation  
- **🔮 Predictive Agent** — forecasting future risks and emerging failure patterns  

These agents operate over telemetry from key business areas (e.g. APIs, authentication, payments, databases, caches) and assign severity levels — *low → critical* — based on both technical and business impact.

## ⚙️ Auto-Healing & Incident Response

For **critical incidents**, the framework can autonomously execute policy-based healing actions such as:
- Service restarts or rollbacks  
- Circuit breaking and rate limiting  
- Traffic redirection or scaling adjustments  

All actions are logged with transparent reasoning and decision traces.

## 🎯 Mission & Goals

The goal of **Incidence AI’s Agentic Reliability Framework** is to give reliability and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams an AI-augmented **“control tower”** that:

- ⏱️ Reduces time to detect, resolve and prevent incidents  
- 🧩 Surfaces clear, human-readable explanations of what went wrong and why  
- 💰 Quantifies potential revenue and user impact  
- 🤖 Safely automates high-confidence recovery actions in real time
