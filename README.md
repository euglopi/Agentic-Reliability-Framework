Agentic Reliability Framework is a production‑grade, multi-layer AI reliability system designed for modern cloud and enterprise environments. It continuously monitors critical business services, detects anomalies in real time, explains impact in business terms, and triggers policy-based self‑healing actions.
At its core, the system uses three specialized AI agents working together:
Detective Agent for anomaly detection and pattern recognition across latency, error rate, and throughput
Diagnostic Agent for root-cause analysis and incident investigation
Predictive Agent for forecasting future risks and emerging failure patterns
These agents operate over telemetry from key business components (e.g., APIs, auth, payments, databases, caches) and assign severity levels (low → critical) based on both technical and business impact. For critical incidents, the framework can autonomously execute policy-based healing actions such as restarts, rollbacks, circuit breaking, or traffic shifting, while logging transparent reasoning and decisions.
The goal of Incidence AI’s Agentic Reliability Framework is to give reliability and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams an AI‑augmented “control tower” that:
Reduces time to detect and resolve incidents
Surfaces clear, human-readable explanations of what went wrong and why
Quantifies potential revenue and user impact
Safely automates high-confidence recovery actions in real time
